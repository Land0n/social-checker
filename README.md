# social-checker
Bulk check popular social media sites for username avaibility. 

Supports Instagram, Steam Community, Instagram, Minecraft, and GitHub.
All available names are output to "available.txt". 

> git clone https://github.com/landoncrabtree/social-checker.git

> pip install requests

Create a file called "available.txt" in the directory of the program.
Add HTTPS proxies into "proxies.txt". 

Make the program directory your active/current directory.

> python3 <script>
(For example, if you want to check GitHub names;
> python3 github.py
  
It'll then ask for the wordlist, so just enter that:
> 3char.txt


I recommend https://proxy.webshare.io for HTTP(S) proxies. I've used them personally, and the speeds are great and entirely exclusive to oyu.
